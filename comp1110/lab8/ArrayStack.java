/**
 * This class represents a stack, in which elements are added and removed in a
 * last in, first out (LIFO) order. Duplicate elements are permitted.
 * When a stack is first created, it contains no elements.
 * The stack can grow to fit new elements as required.
 * Attempting to pop() or peek() an empty stack throws an EmptyStackException,
 * and does not result in any modification to the stack.
 * The Stack is implemented using an array data structure (a regular Java array),
 * and does not use any of the Java Collection classes other than
 * java.util.EmptyStackException.

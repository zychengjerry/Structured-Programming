# COMP1110 Lab 7

### Before the Lab

* Complete week 8 of your personal journal, commit and push at least 5 minutes prior to the start of your lab.
* * Make sure you've covered module [**J14**](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp1110/lectures/java/#J14) (Collections).

### Purpose

In this lab you will solve a simple search problem to find all of the different orderings of planting crops, given some basic rules.

**It is important to complete this lab.   Your tutor will mark your engagement during the lab.**  You will receive a mark of 0.9 for full engagement and a small bonus (a mark of 1.0) if you completed all the tasks during the lab (your tutor will use the CI to check this --- you don't need to be marked off).

## Part I: 30-Minute Check-In

As usual, you will do _two_ things during the 30-minute check-in:

1.  Check in with **your tutor** together with the other members of your group.    Briefly outline any issues you're having that you'd particularly like help with during the lab (make sure you have your journal open and refer to it when you meet with your tutor).
2.  When you're not doing your check-in with your tutor, you should be listening to the **lab leader** as they give an overview of what you'll be going through in this week's lab.

## Part II:  Your Lab Tasks

### Recursion, Sets, and Lists: Crop Rotation

Complete the missing methods (marked `FIXME`) in the `CropRotation` class.   This question is based on a question from the 2020 S1 final exam.   

To solve it, you need to use sets and lists, and you need to solve a search problem, like the [Boggle game](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/comp1110/comp1110-lectures/-/blob/master/src/comp1110/lectures/J14/Boggle.java) we solved in lectures in unit J14. 

1. **Handle Simple Cases**

    It is a good strategy to identify and deal with simple cases first.   In
     this problem, notice that there are a number of circumstances where you
     should return an empty list.  You should address this simple case first.
    
    Add an `if` statement to `getAllRotations()` that checks for the cases where an empty list must be returned, and return the empty `rotations` list.

2. **Implement Switch**

    A search typically involves moving from one possibility to another (for example,
    moving from one die in the [Boggle game](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/comp1110/comp1110-lectures/-/blob/master/src/comp1110/lectures/J14/Boggle.java)
    to another).  Doing so involves at least two considerations:  a) ensuring that 
    the possibility you're considering is not one you've already considered (if
    you don't do this, your search will never complete because you will continuously
    revisit cases you've already encountered), and b) ensuring that you only consider
    _legal_ cases.
    
    Ensuring that you don't consider the same case twice was addressed in the [Boggle game](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/comp1110/comp1110-lectures/-/blob/master/src/comp1110/lectures/J14/Boggle.java)
    by using an array of booleans called `used[]`, and the code carefully
    kept track of which dice were already considered in the current search (you
    may want to inspect the `findWords()` method in the [Boggle game](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/comp1110/comp1110-lectures/-/blob/master/src/comp1110/lectures/J14/Boggle.java)
    to see how this was done).   In this problem you've been given a `List` of 
    `Vegetables` called `used`, which you should use in a similar way, adding
    vegetables to the list when they're being considered, and checking whether
    they're already in the set before you try to use them.
    
    In the [Boggle game](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/comp1110/comp1110-lectures/-/blob/master/src/comp1110/lectures/J14/Boggle.java),
    checking for _legal_ cases was doing by using a set of neighbours, so that
    we knew for each die which were its legal neighbours.   In this case
    you need to implement `canFollow()`, which will allow your code to determine
    whether a particular crop is a legal follower of the current crop.
    
    Use a switch statement to complete the `canFollow()` method, returning the correct value according the the vegetable groups of the `first` and `next` vegetables.
    
3. **Complete the Search**

    You should notice that the `findWords()` method in the [Boggle game](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/comp1110/comp1110-lectures/-/blob/master/src/comp1110/lectures/J14/Boggle.java)
    is not terribly complex once the other parts are in place.   You now 
    need to write the body of `getFixedRotation()`, which will be recursive,
    filling a similar role to `findWords()` method in the [Boggle game](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/comp1110/comp1110-lectures/-/blob/master/src/comp1110/lectures/J14/Boggle.java).

    Write the search by completing `getFixedRotation()`, and adding a `for` loop to `getAllRotations()` that calls `getFixedRotation()` for each of the vegetables in `crops`, adding the vegetable to `used` before calling, and removing it from `used` afterwards. 

### Extension A: JavaFX Drag and Drop

Extend the your Board program from Lab 6 to include drag-and-drop.
    
1. **Create an inner class**

    Create a new inner class `DraggableTriangle`, that extends your inner class `Triangle`.

2. **Add a constructor**

    Add a constructor to your new inner class with the following signature: `DraggableTriangle(double x, double y, double size, Board board)`. Ensure that this constructor calls its parent constructor (`super(x, y, size)`), and then sets the fill color to`RED`.

3. **Add a new field**

    Add a private instance field `board` to your `DraggableTriangle` inner class and initialize it in the constructor (i.e. `this.board = board;`).

4. **Create a draggable triangle**

    Within the `start()` method of your `Board` class, create a new `DraggableTriangle` of size 200, centered at (300, 260), and with the board (i.e. `this`) passed as the fourth argument to the constructor. Remember to add the draggable triangle to your root group.

5. **Make the inner class draggable**

    Make the inner class `DraggableTriangle` draggable. The approach here is to identify how much the mouse has moved (by comparing its current position to its last position), and then move the triangle by that same amount.
    * Add two private instances fields to the inner class, both doubles, to track the location of the mouse as the object is dragged. Call them `mousex` and `mousey`.
	* Remember where the mouse is when it is first pressed, and ensure your triangle remains visible. Do this within the constructor by establishing a handler for mouse presses. You need to add code to the constructor for `DraggableTriangle` that looks something like this:
	
    ````Java
        this.setOnMousePressed(event -> {
        .. your code here ..
        });
    ````
	* Your code should store the current mouse x and y positions in the private fields (e.g. `mousex = event.getSceneX()`, etc), and should ensure the draggable triangle is not covered by other nodes in the scene (call `toFront()` to ensure this).
	* Move the triangle as the mouse is dragged using a handler via `setOnMouseDragged()` in much the same way as you did for `setOnMousePressed()` in the previous step. In that code, find out how much the mouse has moved (e.g. use `event.getSceneX() - mousex`), and change the location of the triangle by the same amount (use `setLayoutX()`, etc). Then remember the new mouse location (updating `mousex` and `mousey`), so that it is all ready for the next time the event occurs.
	
	You should now be able to drag the red triagle around.

6. **Add a distance calculator**

    Add a method to your inner class `Triangle` with signature `private double distance(double x, double y)` that returns the euclidian distance from the center of the triangle to the point (x,y), (using Pythagoras' theorem :-).

7. **Find the nearest triangle**

    Add an instance method to your `Board` class that allows you to find the nearest triangle to a given point, it should have a signature something like `Triangle findNearestTriangle(double x, double y)`. You can do this by simply iterating over all the triangles in your `ArrayList<Triangle>`, and returning the triangle with the smallest distance from (`x`,`y`).

8. **Highlight the nearest**

    Highlight the triangle nearest the draggable triangle:
	* Add a new field to your `Board` class that allows you to remember a 'highlighted' triangle, and initialize the field to `null` (e.g. `Triangle highlighted = null;`).
	* Add a method `void highlightNearestTriangle(double x, double y)` that highlights the triangle nearest a point (`x`, `y`). This method should first un-highlight the currently highlighted triangle (if there is one), by filling it with `LIGHTGREY`. It should then set the variable `highlighted` to be equal to the nearest triangle to (`x`, `y`), and then it should set the fill color of the highlighted triangle to `GREEN` (or whatever color you prefer).
	* Add a line to your `setOnMouseDragged()` event in the constructor of `DraggableTriangle` that calls `board.highlightNearestTriangle()` with the location of your draggable triangle as arguments. You should now find that as you drag your red triangle around, the triangle nearest it is highlighted green.

9. **Snap to nearest triangle**

    Finally, make your draggable triangle snap to the nearest triangle. To do this, add a handler for mouse release (use `setOnMouseReleased()`, just like you did for `setOnMousePressed()` and `setOnMouseDragged()`). In that code, find the nearest triangle to your draggable triangle, and then make the location and orientation of the draggable triangle be the same as that of the nearest triangle (using `setRotate()`, `getRotate()`, `setLayoutX()`, etc.).

10. **Finish off**

    Commit and push your work, close the relevant issue (#19), and notify your tutor.


### Extension B: Hashing

**Create a hash program**

Using the lecture code from C03 as a template:

* Read the data from `assets\us_postal_codes.txt`. Each line contains a postal code,town name, state name, state code,county name, latitude and longitude.


Then:
Imagine you are in charge of the entire US postal service, and you have only 50 delivery officers to cover the entire country (40933 zip codes).
You want to give each person a roughly equal amount of work (imagine each post code has the same amount of mail).

Create a hash function that will:
1. Split the work as evenly as possible (imagine that each post code has the same amount of mail)
2. Minimise the travel each person does as much as possible. Imagine that each person starts at any one of their zip codes, and avoid them having to travel across the country.

You can test 1. by running the program and checking the histogram of results to see if the hash function is even.


How many ways can you do this?

/**
 * An objective is a certain challenge that the player must solve to complete a
 * game of Temple Trap. An objective has two fields:
 *
 *   1. The objective's problem number. There are 60 objectives, each with a
 *      problem number between 1 and 60 inclusive. Generally, as the problem
 *      number increases, so does the difficulty of the objective.
 *   2. The initial state of the objective. This defines the location and
 *      orientation of every tile on the board, as well as the location of the
 *      peg.
 *
 * This class contains one task that you need to complete.
